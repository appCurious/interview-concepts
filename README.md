# Interview Exercises
Each html file is an assesment of Javascript knowledge, an assessment of attention to detail and an assessment of the job position you will experience on the Syndi Team at Syndigo.
These exercises are as much for you as they are for us as a way of determining mutually agreeable employment. 
Is the technology introduced here something you are interested in?  Would you rather be on a team working with a well known framework? 

Instructions are in each html file.

The outcome of each exercise indicates to us what your programming style (coding style) looks like and the skill level you are currently programming at.

These exercises are a glimpse into the daily work you could anticipate encountering if you were to be hired

## Getting Started
Branch off of main to make your personal feature branch
Use the webserver of your choice to serve the files
Review each index file as they are the coding evaluations
Make changes to the html files to correct the issues we have identified

Happy Coding

## When You Are Satisfied With Your Work
zip up your solution ( we don't want your great code pushed to the repo for someone else to copy )
email the zip to the Syndi employee you are coordinating with
