# Interview Exercises
Each html file and associated exercise.js file is an assesment of Javascript knowledge, an assessment of attention to detail and an assessment of the job position you will experience on the Syndi Team at Syndigo.
These exercises are as much for you as they are for us as a way of determining mutually agreeable employment. 
Is the technology introduced here something you are interested in?  Would you rather be on a team working with a well known framework? 

Instructions are in each exercise html file and corresponding exrcise js.

The outcome of each exercise indicates to us what your programming style (coding style) looks like and the skill level you are currently programming at.

These exercises are a glimpse into the daily work you could anticipate encountering if you were to be hired
