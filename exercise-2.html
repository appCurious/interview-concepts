            Continue to modify exercises/exercise-1.js

            - the original criteria is still the same
                - have default content display over the main image on a wide view
                - if you were able, have alternative content display over the main image when the first thumb is selected
                - function return types must not be changed
                - function names cannot change

            
            - THIS EXERCISE 
                - we want to see the mobile image receives the content
                - emulate a mobile device OR resize your window to find when the Narrow version of the retail site displays
                - make changes to the code so that content displays over the mobile image

                - try to make it dynamic so that while changing the window size the content appears over the correct image

            SUCCESS will be measured in levels
                - does content display over the image on wide view
                - does content display over the image on narrow view ( mobile emulator / small window )
                - does the content display in the correct location when the page is refreshed on wide or narrow view

                - does the content display in the correct location dynamically as the window size is changed
                    you will not lose points if this is not successful
                    see what you can do with it ;)

            HINTS
                break the problem into small steps
                understand the DOM structure and how it changes
