        <!-- INTERVIEW Injection Exercise
            Snab What?  We use snabby to work with DOM manipulation and component rendering
            snabby is a convenience wrapper for snabbdom

            Your turn to build out a module to display content

            We will be injecting your content into the retail page for you
            We will target <div id="main-content">

            work with code in exercises/exercise-3.js

                - we'll call init with configurations
                - we'll call view to render your component

                - build out the view function to display on the retail page
                - build out the init function to accept and maintain data that is essential to the view
                - main-content will be in both narrow and wide views
                - use your knowlege of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                - use best practices

            SUCCESS will be measured in levels
                - were you able to create snabby content
                - did your content render on the page
                
                - how far did you get with the instructions
